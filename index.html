      <h2>About Robin Williams</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info">
        Robin McLaurin Williams (July 21, 1951 – August 11, 2014) was an
        American actor and comedian. Known for his improvisational skills and
        the wide variety of characters he created on the spur of the moment and
        portrayed on film, in dramas and comedies alike, he is often regarded as
        one of the best comedians of all time. Williams began performing
        stand-up comedy in San Francisco and Los Angeles during the mid-1970s,
        and rose to fame playing the alien Mork in the ABC sitcom Mork & Mindy
        (1978–1982). After his first starring film role in Popeye (1980),
        Williams starred in several critically and commercially successful films
        including The World According to Garp (1982), Moscow on the Hudson
        (1984), Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Dead Poets Society (1989),
        Awakenings (1990), The Fisher King (1991), Patch Adams (1998), One Hour
        Photo (2002), and World's Greatest Dad (2009). He also starred in box
        office successes such as Hook (1991), Aladdin (1992), Mrs. Doubtfire
        (1993), Jumanji (1995), The Birdcage (1996), Good Will Hunting (1997),
        and the Night at the Museum trilogy (2006–2014). He was nominated for
        four Academy Awards, winning Best Supporting Actor for Good Will
        Hunting. He also received two Primetime Emmy Awards, six Golden Globe
        Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and five Grammy Awards.
